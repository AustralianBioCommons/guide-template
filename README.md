## About

This template is intended to house material for step-by-step guides and other associated documentation that support the reuse of bioinformatics tools, workflows and data on Australian compute systems and infrastructure.

The template aims to:

- Reduce time spent creating guides by providing a standard structure to develop and maintain guidance material; and,
- Allow linking to Zenodo, and DOIs for each release

Please see the [How-to Guide for the template]() for more information on how to get started.
